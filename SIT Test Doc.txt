What Is SIT Testing 

System integration testing (SIT) is a high-level software testing process 
in which testers verify that all related systems 
maintain data integrity and can operate in coordination with other systems in the same environment.


Types of SIT:

There are two major approaches to System Integration Testing: top-down integration approach and bottom-up integration approach.

Top-down Integration Approach: 
Here modules are integrated by moving downwards in hierarchy, 
where the main module is at the top. In a top-down approach if lower modules are not ready a dummy 
modules called a stub is used for testing. A stub acts as the module during the test. Stubs have the minimum 
functionality required to be used while testing the ‘above’ module.


Bottom-up Integration Approach: 
Here modules are combined and started to test at very low level. 
If the top level modules are not ready then drivers are used for testing. A driver is a program specially used for testing.
