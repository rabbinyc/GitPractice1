Output: This is my first program in java


4 main concepts of Object Oriented programming are:

Abstraction
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism

int num;
Similarly we can assign the values to the variables while declaring them, like this:

char ch = 'A';
int number = 100;
or we can do it like this:

char ch;
int number;
...
ch = 'A';
number  = 100;

Variables naming convention in java
1) Variables naming cannot contain white spaces, for example: int num ber = 100; 
is invalid because the variable name has space in it.
2) Variable name can begin with special characters such as $ and _
3) As per the java coding standards the variable name should begin with a lower case letter, for example int number; 
For lengthy variables names that has more than one words do it like this: int smallNumber; int bigNumber; (start the second word with capital letter).
4) Variable names are case sensitive in Java.
